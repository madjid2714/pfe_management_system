# pfe_management_system

# Description
The objective of the project is to design and implement an online system that automates
the management and assignment of end-of-study projects. The system will allow teachers to
propose themes for end-of-studies projects to students, the latter will be able to
choose or modify their choices. The system will also make it possible to automate the allocation of
PFE to students, this task is currently done in a totally manual way.
